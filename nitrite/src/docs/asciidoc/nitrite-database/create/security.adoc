A nitrite database can be secured using a username password pair. The username and password can be set
only once while creating the database. Nitrite does not store raw password, so retrieval or change of
password is not possible. Adding a new username password pair is also not possible for existing database.

.Example
[source,java]
--
Nitrite db = Nitrite.builder()
        .filePath("/tmp/test.db")
        .openOrCreate("username", "password");
--

NOTE: Nitrite does not support access control.
