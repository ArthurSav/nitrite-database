Once a database is opened it acquires an exclusive lock to the data file. So if
a database is opened in a process, further attempt to open it from another process
will fail. Proper closing of a database will release the file lock.

While opening the database, nitrite registers itself to a JVM shutdown hook, which
before exiting will close the database without persisting any unsaved changes to the
disk. This shutdown hook protects the data file from corruption due to JVM shutdown
before properly closing the database.
