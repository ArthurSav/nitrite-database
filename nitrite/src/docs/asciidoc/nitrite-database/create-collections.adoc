To create or open a NitriteCollection call

[source,java]
--
NitriteCollection collection = db.getCollection("collectionName");
--

If no collection exists with the name in the database, a new
collection with the given name will be created. But if there is
already a collection with the same name in the database, it will
be opened.

Similarly, to create or open an ObjectRepository call

[source,java]
--
ObjectRepository<Employee> repository = db.getRepository(Employee.class);
--

If no object repository of the given type exists in the database, a new
one will be created; otherwise the existing one will be opened.
