A nitrite database should be closed before exiting from the program.
When a database is opened, it acquires an exclusive lock to the data file.
Closing a database releases the lock. Prior to closing, nitrite will persists
all unsaved changes to the disk and compacts the data file by moving all
chunks next to each other.

To close a database call
[source,java]
--
db.close();
--

TIP: Once a database is closed, no further operation is possible on the instance
with out properly opening it again.

To check if a database is already closed, use below method.

[source,java]
--
db.isClosed();
--
