Collection supports usual CRUD operations and indexing operations which will be discussed in details
in coming sections. Apart from these it supports other operations also.

**Drop**

[source,java]
--
collection.drop();
--

It drops the `collection` and all of it indices associated with it. Any further
access to a dropped collection would result into an error.

[source,java]
--
boolean isDropped = collection.isDropped();
--

Above code checks if a collection has already been dropped or not.

NOTE: The `drop()` operation raises a *DROP* event.

**Close**

[source,java]
--
collection.close();
--

It closes the `collection` for further access. If a NitriteCollection
is closed once, it can only be opened from a nitrite instance. Any
access to a closed collection would result into an error.

[source,java]
--
boolean isClosed = collection.isClosed();
--

The above code checks if the `collection` is already closed or not.

NOTE: The `close()` operation raises a *CLOSE* event.
