Replication synchronizes one Nitrite instance with another using a Nitrite DataGate server.
Nitrite supports both-way replication.

Configuring replication is very easy in Nitrite, provided a DataGate server is already setup.

NOTE: Replication is fully automatic after it is started once and runs in background thread.

The application code doesn't have to pay attention to the details: it just knows that when
it makes changes to the local Nitrite instance they will eventually be replicated to all
other remote Nitrite instances.
