A data recovery tool also comes with Nitrite as a built-in tool to recover from a
corrupted data file. While opening a database if Nitrite finds the file is corrupted,
it uses this tool to recover from it using a last known good version of the database.

This tool can also be used from application code on-demand.

.Example
[source,java]
--
Recovery.recover(dataFilePath);
--
