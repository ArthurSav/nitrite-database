Along with NitriteCollection, nitrite also supports ObjectRepository
icon:file-code-o[link="http://static.javadoc.io/org.dizitart/nitrite/{version}/org/dizitart/no2/objects/ObjectRepository.html", window="_blank"].
It is a persistent generic collection of POJO classes. Internally it is backed by a NitriteCollection, where an object
is converted into a Document and then stored.

An ObjectRepository also supports the same set of operations that NitriteCollection supports. It is also observable and
tread-safe for concurrent use.

NOTE: ObjectRepository does not allow `null` or empty string as an id value.

TIP: ObjectRepository is thread-safe for concurrent use.
