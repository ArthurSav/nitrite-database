Nitrite DataGate server facilitates the replication between multiple
Nitrite instances. The replication logic triggers from the client end. It
runs in a background thread at a configured interval. If the previous run is not
completed within the configured interval, the next run will be skipped.

*Steps*

* If the replication type is configured as *PULL*, the replicator will download
all changes from server to local and updates local collection accordingly.

** It first checks if the server is online.
** If online, it will try to acquire sync lock for server copy.
** Once lock is acquired, it reads the last sync time stored in the metadata of local collection.
** Gets the change feed from the server copy from last sync time.
** Updates the local collection with the remote change feed.
** Updates last sync time received from server and store it in local metadata.
** Releases remote sync lock.

* If the replication type is configured as *PUSH*, the replicator will upload
all changes from local to server.

** It first checks if the server is online.
** If online, it will try to acquire sync lock for server copy.
** Once lock is acquired, it reads the last sync time stored in the metadata of local collection.
** Gets the change feed of local from last sync time to current time.
** Updates the server with the local change feed.
** Updates the last sync time metadata in local.
** Releases remote sync lock.

* If the replication type is configured as *BOTH_WAY*, the replicator will merge
changes.

** It first checks if the server is online.
** If online, it will try to acquire sync lock for server copy.
** Once lock is acquired, it reads the last sync time stored in the metadata of local collection.
** Gets the change feed of both server copy and local collection from last sync time.
** Updates the server copy with the local change feed.
** Updates the local collection with the remote change feed.
** Updates last sync time received from server and store it in local metadata.
** Releases remote sync lock.

*Sync Lock*

Sync lock is a mechanism to let other replicating clients know that the
remote server is currently replicating with a client, so that others will
not attempt to change the server data until the replication is completed.

A lock is acquired by updating *syncLock* metadata attribute with current
epoch time in server. Every sync lock write is also associated
with an expiry time metadata by updating the *expiryWait* attribute.

In case if a replicating client fails to release the sync lock, another client will wait
until server's current epoch time is greater than the value of *expiryWait* metadata.
After it expires the new client will acquire lock and starts replication.

*ChangeFeed*

ChangeFeed
icon:file-code-o[link="http://static.javadoc.io/org.dizitart/nitrite/{version}/org/dizitart/no2/sync/ChangeFeed.html", window="_blank"]
is the list of all cumulative changes in a collection (for both remote and local)
within a certain time period. Feed is obtained using the document metadata and the
remove log of a collection.

Once replication is enabled for a collection, it maintains a remove log
which keeps track of the removed documents from the local collection.
Replicator collects the deleted documents details from the remove log
for a certain time interval to create the *_removed feed_*.

Replicator uses the *_created* and *_modified* attributes of a document
to generate the *__updated feed__* and *__created feed__* of a ChangeFeed.

*Sync Events*

There are 5 different events for various life cycle stages of a replication.

- STARTED
- IN_PROGRESS
- COMPLETED
- CANCELED
- STOPPED
- REPLICATION_ERROR

Events can be listened to via an implementation of SyncEventListener
icon:file-code-o[link="http://static.javadoc.io/org.dizitart/nitrite/{version}/org/dizitart/no2/sync/SyncEventListener.html", window="_blank"]
registered during configuration.
